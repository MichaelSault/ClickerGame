    			<summary>About</summary>
    			This is the first of a number of web based games I want to add to this site.  Inspired by cookie clicker, I figured this would be an easy way to start.
    		</details>
    		<details>
    			<summary>How To Play</summary>
    			This game plays like a standard <i>clicker game</i> in that you begin by clicking a button to receive a coin and work your way up to be able to purchase upgrades which will eventually automate the clicking process for you.
