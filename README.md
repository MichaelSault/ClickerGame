A Pirate Clicker Game

**This game is currently playable at:**

The game is "won" by purchasing the "Pirate Space Ship" which in turn requires the Alien Research to unlock.
Other than that, this game plays like your typical cookie clicker game.


All pirate assets/images were drawn by me, specifically for this game.

The font family used ("Booter") was indicated as free for personal and commercial use and can be found here:
